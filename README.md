Ensure the directory structure is as follows:
/public
    - index.html
    - styles.css
    - app.js
/uploads  (this directory will be created automatically by multer when files are uploaded)
- patient-data.json
- server.js

Save the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON files in a directory structure like this:
Code
/public
    - index.html
    - styles.css
    - app.js
- patient-data.json
- server.js

Install Node.js and Express if you haven't already, then run npm init -y and npm install express.

Start the server with node server.js.

Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the patient medical content.

This is a basic example to get you started. For a real application, you would need to add authentication, secure data handling, and more robust error handling
